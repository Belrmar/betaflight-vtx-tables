## **What do "global", "fcc" or "eu" mean in the table filenames?**

Global: Unlocked VTX. All Power Levels, All Frequencies. Mostly not legal in the EU or in FCC regions.

FCC: Frequencies disabled that are not legal in FCC regions. (This mostly affects the BOSCAM E band and "Low Bands")

EU: Frequencies and power levels disabled that are not legal in the EU.



## Contributing / Can't find your VTX?

This is a community effort, so feel free to create Pull requests or Issues to let me now, if something is missing or is wrong. If you want your VTX added or you need a table for your region, create an issue with your specific model and maybe a link where it can be bought.
